          # Fraud Detection using Random Forest Classifier 🌲💳

This project demonstrates how to build a fraud detection system using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used is a credit card transactions dataset, where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions.

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## Data Preprocessing 🧹

1. Load the data from a CSV file.
2. Separate features and target variable.
3. Handle imbalanced data using undersampling.

## Model Training 🚀

1. Split the data into training and test sets.
2. Train a Random Forest Classifier on the training data.

## Model Evaluation 📊

1. Make predictions on the test data.
2. Evaluate the model's accuracy using accuracy score and classification report.

## Results 📈

The model's accuracy and classification report will be printed after running the code. These metrics indicate how well the model is able to identify fraudulent transactions.
